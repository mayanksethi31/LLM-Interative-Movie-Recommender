## Idea

We propose to develop a Movie Recommendation System that utilizes OpenAI's ChatGPT API and TMDB API. Our goal is to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their input. The system will consist of the following components:

Firstly, the system will utilize OpenAI's ChatGPT API to generate human-like text that understands user input and provides personalized movie recommendations. The system will accept user input in the form of movie titles or genres.

Secondly, the system will use TMDB API to fetch movie data for the recommended movies, including the movie's title, overview, and rating.

Thirdly, the system will store user data in a PostgreSQL database to enable personalized recommendations for returning users.

Lastly, we'll provide the users with an interactive web UI built with React.JS and integrate it with the Flask backend system.

The system will be deployed in a Docker container, which will provide a scalable and efficient platform for the project.
