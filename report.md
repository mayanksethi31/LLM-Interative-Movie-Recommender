### What was our original objective and how much progress we made?

We proposed an idea to develop a Movie Recommendation System that utilizes OpenAI's ChatGPT API and TMDB API.
Our main goal was to provide a personalized movie recommendation to users based on their own inputs/mood. 
We were able to finish most of our objectives. Based on the feedback we received, we didn't have to do the front end section. 

Key objectives that were achieved are as follows: 

Able to interact with OpenAI's ChatGPT endpoint to understand human-like text that understands user input and provides personalized movie recommendations based on different moods. 

Used TMDB API to fetch movie data that includes movie titles. 

Our initial idea was to use MongoDB, but at the end, the team was able to use PostgreSQL to store and personalize recommendations for returning users. 

Furthermore, the team was able to run the core code pieces in a nice fashion using the power of docker and yaml. 

### Extra feature that was achieved, but was not not included in the initial plan 

The team was also able to add a personalized email feature for movie recommendation using SendGrid. 

We also created an analytics section that keeps track of user past interaction with the system. 

### Limitations and items not achieved at this time

Initially with this project, we planned to also include a front end that interacts directly with users, but this was outscope for the main purpose of the project. 

Another item that we didn't include this time was the ability to include all the edge cases involved in using OpenAI. However, this is also outscope of the project. 

### Description of how the project works: 

Coming soonâ€¦ 

### Lessons learned: 

Overall I think the team learned a lot from this project because we basically designed a system from scratch, and then made it interact with an advanced technology such as OpenAI. With this project, we implemented the skills learned from the course.
